            <h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>
                <h3>Long term goals</h3>
                    <p>	My long term goal is to get a job in marine biology. I want to achieve this goal because I want to help animals and save them from all the dangers that could happen to them. As soon as I can I am leaving Fresno and going to Texas to go to school and get a better education so I can achieve my dream.
Another long term goal I have is to get another job in photography. I want to get a job in photography because I feel like I can take professional pictures. I also want to join photography because itâ€™ll be good for marine biology, so I can save every moment helping every animal I can.  
</p>
                <h3>Short Term Goals</h3>
                <p>My short term goal is to finish high school and go to a 2 year college and learn more about being a marine biologist. I also want to learn how to take professional pictures. So after I get out of school for marine biology I will go to another 2 year college and learn how to take better professional pictures. </p>

                <h3>Educational</h3>
                <p>One of my accomplishments for school is I learned how to make my own website. There is a lot of things you have to learn and my goal is by the end of the year to make my own website by myself without help. And also another thing I learned is to collaborate and work with a team a lot better. And also I learned how to speak more within a group and help give out my ideas.</p>
